# RPCN Player Count Viewer

This PHP application fetches and displays the current number of players in PlayStation 3 games on RPCS3.

A JSON file (`games.json`) is required to map game titles, communication IDs, and title IDs because the RPCN API does not provide game titles.

Please keep in mind that the current JSON file is missing plenty of titles. Because of that not every game will be displayed.
